2008-07-12: Some sort of reasoning needed, at least generalization. 
            Example in edifact/x12 code: I'd like to query msg-segment-group.pos
	    not x12-msg-segment-group-pos and edifact-segment-group-pos 
            (And note that they are in differing DBs.) Handling differing ordering
            of the roles would be nice too.

(x12-msg-segment-group.pos ?msg ?gnum ?pos) -> (msg-segment-group.pos ?msg ?num ?pos)
(edifiact-msg-segment-group.pos ?msg ?pos ?gnum) -> (msg-segment-group.pos ?msg ?num ?pos)

- Is (trie-add '(something nil)) a problem?
