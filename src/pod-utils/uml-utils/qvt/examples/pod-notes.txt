Reviewing the possibility of using the ModelMorf files as regression tests for my work. 
It might be useful to produce from my tooling, exactly the same diagnostic output that
ModelMorf produces, and then write a regression tester tool that calls both and
compares the results. 

For each of the XMI files in this directory:

(1) Replace the Package element with a model element.
(2) Replace the ownedType elements with ownedMember elements
(3) Replace type="Class" with type="uml:Class"

Time to use more XSLT?

Man, have these things been sitting around for this long?!?!  I now have both ModelMorf and dv-profil examples. 
They both are based on Eclipse generated metamodels. Would it be useful to read those?

====> The problem seems to be that none of these things supply populations!
