The source models are reprsented either in xmi or uml. 
The umlclass_diagram is the UML class diagram file of the Eclipse UML2 Toolkit.
You may do the modeling with the (an) UML2 tool. For transformation you need  
the model in xmi or uml representation. The Eclipse UML modeling delivers uml 
automatically, just like Topcase for example.
