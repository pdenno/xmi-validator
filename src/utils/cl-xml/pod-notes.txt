Created from a clean (just downloaded) copy of XML-0-949-20030409T2320-CRLF.
I then did dos2unix and committed to CVS. 

(1) I committed a set of modifications allowing it to compile 
    - replace without-interrupts with mp:with-interrupts-blocked, 
    - "BIN" --> "ufasl"
    - removed the #-lispworks from inline in atn-lisp-compiler.lisp 

 I get lots of stack overflows (didn't do the MACOS patches yet) BUT

Timing the evaluation of 
(SETF *MMM* (XML-PARSER:DOCUMENT-PARSER "/local/lisp/pod-utils/uml-utils/data/uml23/09-09-23.cmof"))

User time    =       39.818
System time  =        0.020
Elapsed time =       47.479
Allocation   = 9929746764 bytes
0 Page faults
Calls to %EVAL    30632643

Which for some reason, is (though still atrocious) better. 

(2) The MACOS patches: 
 Note that their are TWO, and both need be applied:
   - 0-949-P20030603
   - 0-949-P20040211

But what is 0-949-P20030805? It is not on the James.Anderson site anywhere. 

I decide to apply all 3.

: 0-949-P20030603
User time    =       37.750
System time  =        0.032
Elapsed time =       43.668
Allocation   = 9929745304 bytes
0 Page faults
Calls to %EVAL    30632643

: 0-949-P20030805
  - My files seem to have all of these patches (and more in xml-printer.lisp)

: 0-949-P20040211
  - My files seem to have all of these patches (and more in xml-printer.lisp)
  - This makes me wonder.

: I'm going to merge in POD changes from old-current.
    - One change from xml-printer.lisp (others were anticipated by Anderson)
    - One change in xml-stream-coding.lisp (my call to canonical-encoding). 
    - One change in xml-parser.lisp (use .ufasl, not .bin).
    - One change in parameters.lisp adding :windows1252

GOT IT!!!  (Who knows why!)
2018: I know why; it says so in the directory-level
(contains all distributions of cl-xml) pod-notes.txt file: Earlier attempts
were not compiling the parser!

User time    =        1.916
System time  =        0.024
Elapsed time =        1.941
Allocation   = 19769088 bytes
0 Page faults

Fastest ever!
