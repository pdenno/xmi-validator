<h1 id='introduction'>Validation Tools</h1>

This site provides the NIST XMI Validator, a tool for the validation of XMI exchange files. 
<br/>The tool was originally developed by <a href="http://nist.gov">NIST</a>.
<p/>
The most straightforward use of this tool involves going to the menu item 'Validate Models'
(see menu on left) and loading an XMI file. More complex usages may involve loading profiles
('Load Profiles'), loading whole metamodels ('Load Metamodels') and loading model fragments
('Load Fragments') and then loading for validation a model which references these profiles, 
metamodels and model fragments ('Validate Models').
