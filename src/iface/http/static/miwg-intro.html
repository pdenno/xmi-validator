<h1>Tool For the OMG's Model Interchange Working Group (MIWG)</h1>

This is the home of the Validator tool used by the MIWG, 
co-hosted by NIST and 
<a href='http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/exit_nist.cgi?url=http://www.acq.osd.mil/se/'>
DoD's Systems and Software Engineering office</a>.

The Validator provides an environment for SE tool developers to assess 
the interoperability of their implementations. Interoperability
among SE tools is essential to the development of complex systems and system-of-systems 
(SoS) analysis. Such work often involves the collaboration of many disparate organizations.
This work environment usually does not permit organizations to standardize on a single SE
tool, and often not even on the same standard (e.g., SysML(tm)).
