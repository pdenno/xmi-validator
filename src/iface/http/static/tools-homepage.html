<h1>Developer Tools</h1>

This site provides the MIWG with tools to aid 
<a href='/se-interop/miwg#interop'>conformance testing</a> 
and <a href='/se-interop/miwg#interop'>interoperability testing</a>.
The tools are designed to help implementors get started with the exercises.
The UML/SysML Validator, which does structure checking, is an example of 
a conformance tool. Conformance is, roughly speaking, a prerequisite of interoperability 
and hence important to the MIWG.  The Model Diff Tool is an example of an 
interoperability tool. 
<p/>
The tools currently available or under development (listed by exchange standard) are:
<ul>
 <li><a href='/se-interop/sysml-tools-overview'>SysML Tools</a> - that provide (1) a Class Browser
     for UML and the SysML Profile; (2) structure checking of SysML models for violations
     of UML/SysML type, and multiplicity specifications and checking of OCL constraints 
     defined in the UML and the SysML specifications; and, (3) a 'Model Diff' tool 
     that reports differences across two models.</li>
</ul>
